# Highwind
Designs for producing a working Highwind airship model from Final Fantasy 7

## Aim
To create a scale model of the Highwind airship, combined with the workings of a drone in order to 'fly'.

## Questions to answer:

- [ ]  What are the dimensions of the airship in the game?
- [ ]  What are the moving parts of the model?
- [ ]  What limitations will be from the electronics required for drone flight?
- [ ]  Will the drone engines only give puward thrust, or more control?
